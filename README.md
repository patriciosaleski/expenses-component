### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

This is my first challenge done from Frontend Mentor website, I decided to teardown the given designs and work with it, creating a map with the html and css code to recreate the original design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

First of all, I learned to recreate dynamic charts with JavaScript, data given from a .json file and generate each HTML element with the styles done with SASS. I think I can use it for other projects with more or less elements.
